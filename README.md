# Smart Building: Smart Surveillance Security System
This project aims to design a smart building by implementing a smart building with smart surveillance security system. Surveillance devices prove to be a great source of protection due to the exponential increase in burglary and theft activities. The smart surveillance system monitor the presence of human and performs a face recognition function to reduce the error caused due to motion detection. The PIR sensor willdetect the motion and buzzer will act as an alarm to alert the unknown user. It notified the users when someone approached the smart building through a mobile application once the system completed the facial recognition process. The smart surveillance system developed using Raspberry Pi 3B+ has been successfully developed with the integration to mobile applications.
